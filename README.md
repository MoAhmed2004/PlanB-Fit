## ✨ What It Does

*   🤖 **Plan B AI Generator:** Machine busy? Input the occupied equipment and instantly get a personalized alternative matched to your profile, injuries, and available gear. Earn +30 XP per alternative.
*   ⚡ **AI Routine Generator:** No routine? Answer 5 quick questions (goal, fitness level, schedule, equipment, injuries) and get a complete personalized training plan in under 30 seconds. Supports PPL, Upper/Lower, Full Body, Bro Split, or "Let AI Decide."
*   📸 **Vision Routine Extractor:** Upload a screenshot of any workout routine (table, PDF, coach's plan) and the app converts it to an interactive exercise list using vision AI.
*   🧠 **Smart Features:** XP & streak system for motivation, real-time gym occupancy dashboard, injury-aware constraints, Google Calendar integration for auto-scheduling, and offline-first local storage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart) with Provider state management
*   **AI Backend:** Manus AI API (async task polling for production-ready mobile integration)
*   **Vision AI:** Multimodal AI for image-to-routine extraction
*   **Local Storage:** SharedPreferences for offline persistence
*   **UI Theme:** Dark mode with neon accents (cyberpunk aesthetic)

## API Integration
The app uses Manus AI's async task API for production-ready mobile integration:

*  task.create — Send a structured prompt with user constraints

*  task.detail — Poll every 3 seconds until the task completes

*  task.listMessages — Fetch the final AI response as structured JSON

This pattern avoids timeouts on mobile and works offline-first.

## Future Roadmap

[ ] Google Calendar auto-scheduling

[ ] Wearable integration (Apple Watch, Wear OS)

[ ] Social features (share routines, compete on streaks)

[ ] Advanced gym occupancy ML predictions

[ ] Nutrition tracking integration

[ ] Voice commands for hands-free operation
